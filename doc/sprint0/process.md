How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

-Divided the tasks based on what people liked and took responsibility of.

-Daily meetings at 6pm to discuss matters that needed the team's opinions and to check on what each individual is working on.

-If anyone had a doubt or wanted to say something then they could communicate using the Messenger and Discord app.

-We have decided on appointing a leader for every week and will lead the daily standups for that week

How did you make decisions?

-We made decisions based on a majority vote. We found having a quick poll on messenger (our main communication channel), to be very helpful. 

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

-We define our priority (high, medium, low) based on what absolutely needs to be implemented for a minimum viable product.

-On average we took two rounds of voting to agree on a decision. First round to speak our opinions, and second rounds to actually come to a consensus.

Did you meet in person or online?

-We were conducting meetings online on the Discord app.

How frequently did you meet?

-We conducted meetings every weekday.

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

-One thing that we will take forward to the next phase is starting early.

-Since we are a large team of seven, communication is absolutely key to being successful and working together
