As the product owners have mentioned, this application is a one of a kind solution to a problem related to current and relevant sports news/debate. Though there is no direct competition as of yet, we can identify similar indirect competition such as the popular ESPN talk show, 'First Take' and Sports Forums such as footballforums.net, insidehoops.com, bigsoccer.com. 

'First Take' features Max Kellerman and Stephen A. Smith, and Molly Qerim, who introduces discussion and debate topics related to sports news which are usually controversial. A lot of these topics include, "GOAT" debates. Most recently on ESPN's youtube channel, posted two days ago, was Stephen A. Smith's unwavering opinion that Michael Jordan will still be the "GOAT" even if Lebron James wins his 4th NBA title (with 500,000 views). Another hot topic typically discussed on ‘First Take’ is match predictions. Most recently discussed by Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman are their match predictions on the NBA finals with Miami Heat versus the LA Lakers (with 1.3million views).

Other sports forums such as Footballforums, provide a thread structure similar to other forums on the web. This structure provides users with ability to create threads with their questions or analysis of particular sports they are interested in but it doesn’t provide them ability to show their excellence and use the forum as a platform to get into the sports analytics field.

Sportcred provides a solution and a way to ‘put your money where your mouth is’. By allowing users to voice their opinions and analysis on the game of basketball, they gain credibility through a scoring system, ACS. This solves the problem of who actually wins a debate on a hot topic, and who was actually correct on a match prediction. ACS also allows users to show off their analytical ability and knowledge which could be useful towards users’ aspirations in the sports analytics field.
